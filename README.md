### 👋 About me

 Hi there, I'm Liliia Hryniuk - a motivated and adaptable professional seeking to leverage my strong communication and problem-solving skills.
📚 Recently completed courses in Java programming, penetration testing, and QA testing, and I am eager to apply my new knowledge and skills to a challenging and rewarding position in the tech industry.

### 💼 My experience

I have experience working as a Content Moderator at Conectys Sp ZOO, where I reviewed and moderated online content to ensure it complied with company policies and community standards. I evaluated user-generated content for appropriateness, quality, and relevance and removed or flagged inappropriate, offensive, or spammy content. I maintained accurate records of moderation activity and provided reports as needed, all while working collaboratively with other team members to ensure a consistent and high-quality user experience.

In addition, I worked as a Warehouse Team Member at Volkswagen Group Polska and Amazon Fulfilment Polska. In these roles, I gained valuable experience collaborating with other team members to meet shipment timetables and reduce errors. I selected, packed, and promptly shipped customer orders and examined products for damage, passing information to the Quality Team. I contributed to team efforts by accomplishing related results as needed and provided quality service by following organization standards.
